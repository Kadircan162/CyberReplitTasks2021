The Catalog class has 3 ArrayLists which represent information about the products.

items -> all items

prices -> prices for each item

monthlyPayments -> monthly payments if you decide to finance

Each piece of information matches by index in ArrayLists.

index of "iPhone 6s Plus" is 1 in items ArrayList, to find its price I need to look at index 1 in prices and monthlyPayments ArrayLists.

Carefully Follow instructions on top/inside of each instance method and and run the unit tests until you pass all of them.
